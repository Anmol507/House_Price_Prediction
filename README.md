House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house prices using linear regression. Linear regression is a powerful algorithm that helps establish a relationship between the independent variable(s) and the target variable. In this case, we aim to understand the factors influencing house prices and create a model that can accurately predict them.

Usage:
1. Data Preparation:
    - Ensure that your dataset contains relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
    - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.

2. Model Training:
    - Utilize the provided code to train a linear regression model on your prepared dataset.
    - Fine-tune the model parameters as needed for optimal performance.

3. Prediction:
    - Once the model is trained, use it to predict house prices by providing new input data.
    - Interpret the predicted values to gain insights into the potential pricing of houses based on the selected features.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
